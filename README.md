# TestMT
Use different MT engines and display differences, with an optional reference and an optional human translation.

This sample project aims at showing differences between some of the main commercial MT engines available online.
In particular we are using Microsoft, Google, ModernMT.
Using different MTs can increase not only productivity but creativity of professional translators, as well as stimulate a debate on the capabilities and shortcomings of current MT engines.

This app has been first presented at the workshop "MACHINE TRANSLATION AND HUMAN CREATIVITY" in Bologna, Italy, in 2021.
